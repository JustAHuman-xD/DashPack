[[Combat]]
	**Earth Slam (Combo)**:
		Dashing into Raised Earth / Earth Pillars with Earth Blast selected pushes them in the direct dashed in towards, crumbling on impact dealing medium damage
		Using Earth Push consumes the dash so you will only move a fraction of the normal distance
	**Earth Crash (Combo)**:
		When mid-air with collapse selected you gain the ability to "dash" downwards (dashing forwards while looking down) where you pull yourself towards the earth.
		This increases your velocity downwards and upon landing if Collapse or Shockwave are selected, will create a ripple 1.5x stronger than normal, also causing collapses throughout the wave of the ripple
