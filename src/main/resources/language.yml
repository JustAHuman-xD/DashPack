      AirCrash:
        Description: AirCrash is a simple technique for amplifying the power of AirBurst. By dashing downwards
          while midair you build more momentum, increasing the resulting AirBurst's knockback and shrinking its area of effect.
        Instructions: AirDash (Down) > AirBurst (From fall)
  Earth:
    EarthDash:
      Description: EarthDash is a different application of the same technique used in Catapulting. EarthDash is an ability that
        allows you to propel yourself using the earth beneath your feet. EarthDash is best for moving horizontally while it's
        vertical power is dampened. However, advanced benders can use EarthDash to plummet downwards while midair when close
        above the ground, pulling themselves to the earth below with great force.

      EarthCrash:
        Description: EarthCrash is an advanced technique amplifying the power of Shockwave. By using EarthDash to plummet
          downwards to the ground, the force of the impact is amplified, increasing the damage, knockback, and reducing the
          area of effect of the resulting Shockwave.
        Instructions: EarthDash (Down) > Shockwave (From fall)
      EarthLaunch:
        Description: EarthLaunch is a combination of Catapult and EarthDash, merging the application of both abilities to
          launch yourself into the air and propel yourself in your dash direction with great force.

      EarthSlam:
        Description: EarthSlam is an advanced technique that turns otherwise defensive barriers into offensive projectiles.
          After raising earth you can use this technique to slam the earth forwards, pushing and knocking back all entities
          in its path.

  Fire:
    FireDash:
      Description: FireDash is a entry-level firebending technique utilizing a blast of fire to propel yourself around. While
        great for horizontal movement, FireDash is not as effective (but not ineffective) for vertical movement.

        Description: LightningStep is an advanced application of the Lightning ability. A firebender can use this technique
          to travel instantly through the bolt of lightning, teleporting to it's end. Be wary of your aim however, if the bolt
          ends inside of a block, you won't get stuck inside but you will feel a bit of a shock.
        Instructions: Lightning (Left click) > Lightning (Left click) > FireDash
      FireTunnel:
        Description: FireTunnel is a simple yet advanced technique that creates a spiraling tunnel of fire in front of you. This
          technique is great in closed spaces, allowing you to hit multiple targets and trap them in a blazing inferno.

  Water:
    WaterDash:
      Description: WaterDash is one of the few waterbending abilities providing mobility. By pushing oneself with pressurized water
        a waterbender can propel themselves around. While outside of water or rain, WaterDash may not have a huge effect, and is
        restricted vertically, but in water or rain, WaterDash becomes an incredibly powerful tool, allowing fast and fluid movement
        in any direction.
